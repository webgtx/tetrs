# Tetrs Engine

`tetrs_engine` is an implementation of a tetromino game engine, able to handle numerous modern
mechanics.

# Examples

```
use tetrs_engine::*;

// Starting a game.
let game = Game::new(Gamemode::marathon());

let button_state_1 = ButtonsPressed::default();
button_state_1[Button::MoveLeft] = true;

let update_time_1 = Duration::from_secs(3);

// Updating the game with 'left' pressed at second 3.
game.update(Some(button_state_1), update_time_1);

// ...

let update_time_2 = Duration::from_secs(4);

// Updating the game with *no* change in (left pressed) button state (since second 3).
game.update(None, update_time_2);

// View game state
let GameState { board, .. } = game.state();
// (Render the board, etc..)
```
